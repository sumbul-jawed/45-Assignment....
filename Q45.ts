It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored

function make_car(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...options: [string, any][]): Object {
    let car: {[key: string]: any} =
    {manufacturer, model};
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => car[key] = value);
       return car; 
    }

    console.log(make_car("Toyota", "Carolla", ["color", "black"], ["year", 2021]));
