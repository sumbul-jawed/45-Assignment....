// 42.Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function make_great1(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(magicians => `The Great ${magicians}`);
}
